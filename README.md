# Task
# Doctor-Scraper: Extracting Doctor Data from Websites

This repository contains a Python script designed to scrape doctor names and clinic addresses from three websites: bookimed.com,clinicsoncall.com and us-uk.bookimed.com

## Setup

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

   No Additional Configuration:
The script doesn't require any specific configuration files or environment variables.

Data Sources
Bookimed.com:

The script scrapes doctor listings from the German section of bookimed.com (https://us-uk.bookimed.com/doctors/country=germany/).

Clinicsoncall.com:

The script scrapes doctor listings from the German section of clinicsoncall.com (https://clinicsoncall.com/en/doctors/country-germany/).

The Script scrapes best checkup doctors in germany.
https://us-uk.bookimed.com/doctors/country=germany/direction=check-up/

Limitations
Website Structure Dependence: The script relies on the current structure of the websites. Changes to these websites might break the scraper.

Rate Limiting: Websites often implement rate limits to prevent excessive scraping. The script doesn't include any rate limiting logic.

Data Consistency: The code assumes a specific structure of the website and that there's a one-to-one correspondence between doctor names and clinic addresses. It may not be able to handle inconsistencies or errors.

Potential Improvements
Robust Error Handling: Implement try-except blocks to handle potential errors during requests, parsing, and data extraction.

Rate Limiting: Add rate limiting logic to avoid overloading the websites.

Data Storage: Use a database or other suitable storage mechanism for more persistent data storage.

Automated Updates: Consider creating a scheduled script to automatically update the scraped data.

More Targeted Scraping: The script currently focuses on extracting doctor names and addresses. You could extend it to extract additional information (e.g., specializations, languages spoken, contact details).

Usage
Run the Python script.

The script will extract data from the specified websites and print the combined data as a Pandas DataFrame.
